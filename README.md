# ZenWall

ZenWall is a lightweight, privacy-first Android firewall app.  
It gives you full control over which apps can access the internet — without analyzing, filtering, or storing any of your traffic.

## Features

- **Privacy First**  
  - ZenWall never inspects, stores, or filters your network packets.  
  - No analytics, no tracking, no third-party servers.  
  - Traffic is either allowed or blocked, nothing else.  

- **Per-App Internet Control**  
  - Block unwanted apps (like noisy games or background data hogs).  
  - Allow only the apps you trust or need online.  

- **Battery & Performance Friendly**  
  - Uses Android’s built-in VPN API in a lightweight way.  
  - No packet forwarding → minimal CPU use and zero speed penalty.  

- **Whitelist Mode for Travel**  
  - Turn on whitelist mode when traveling or roaming.  
  - Only essential apps get access, reducing costs and saving data.  

- **Simple and Clear**  
  - Clean, intuitive interface.  
  - Two modes: **Blacklist** (block selected apps) or **Whitelist** (allow only selected apps).  
  - See your currently blocked apps at a glance.

## Why ZenWall?

Most firewalls work by analyzing traffic, which can expose your data and drain your battery.  
ZenWall is different:  

- It doesn’t filter packets — it simply decides which apps may connect.  
- It doesn’t log traffic — your online activity is yours alone.  
- It doesn’t need root — works out of the box with Android’s VPN API.  

This makes ZenWall one of the most privacy-respecting, lightweight, and effective firewalls you can run on your device.

## Getting Started

1. Install ZenWall on your device.  
2. Open the app and toggle the firewall on.  
3. Choose Blacklist or Whitelist mode.  
4. Select the apps you want to block or allow.  
5. ZenWall quietly protects your device in the background.

## Example Use Cases

- Save battery and data: cut off background-hungry apps.  
- Travel smart: whitelist only essential apps to reduce roaming costs.
